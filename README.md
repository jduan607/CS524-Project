# Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Package Delivery and Trajectory Optimization
CS524 Intro to Optimization (Fall 2018) Project
Authors: Jingqi Duan, Huanran Li, Chongxi Yuan

## Background
Recently, the potential of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been recognized in a variety of ways, such as entertainment, photographing, and even military purposes. Meanwhile, a fast and efficient logistics system is needed more than ever due to the increase of demand for online retail. Amazon has started to explore the possibilities of UAV package delivery since 2016 and released several videos of "[prime air](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?ie=UTF8&node=8037720011)". Amazon believes that by using UAVs, packages could be delivered to their customers within 30 minutes.

## Models
|Model|Goal|
|-----|-----|
|1    |To find the path which consumes the least energy when the time line of dropping several pacakges is fixed.|
|2    |To not only optimize the route, but also find the best sequence of dropping and dropping time.|
|3    |To optimize the route for the fastest delivery, with the limitation of total energy consumption.|
|4    |To optimize the height of the path in three-dimensional space and modify the height to adapt with terrain's rise and fall.|
